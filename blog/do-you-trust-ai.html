      <h1>Do you trust AI?</h1>
      <time datetime="2025-06-27">June 27, 2025</time>

      <p>
        More and more often, when I have some question, I hear the answer: “Just ask the chat.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Earlier, when I wanted to get an answer to my question or get some information on any topic, I just googled it and searched for websites that had the information I needed.
        After reading the information on different websites,
        I formed some opinion on this topic and there it was – now I had the answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, if I want to get some answers, I just go to an AI chat (there are a lot of them), type my question and immediately get the answer.
        The AI looks around the internet for me and generates a simple response in understandable human language.
      </p>

      <p>
        So why am I raising this topic? Isn’t this great? In fact, the answer is ambiguous.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Over time, the technology we use evolves, and with this evolution, sometimes we become lazier, more trusting of the technology we use, and it becomes easier to manipulate us using this technology. In the past, if we found a wiretap in our home, we would be scared and we would think that we were being watched.
        Today, each of us has a smartphone in front of us (or in our pocket) that is equipped with a mic,
        camera, GPS, internet connection and a ton of sensors. And we don’t see any problem with this.
        Actually, it's the opposite — we take it with us everywhere and always check that it's close to us.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We tell all our thoughts to the AI chat and we don’t ask any questions about the answer we got.
        We don’t know where the AI service we use saves our thoughts and questions, from what sources it gets its answers,
        and more importantly, we don’t know if we can trust these sources. We no longer form our opinions based on different sources with different views — we just want to get an opinion that is formed for us.
      </p>
