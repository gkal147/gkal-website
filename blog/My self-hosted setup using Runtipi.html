      <h1>My self-hosted setup using Runtipi</h1>
      <time datetime="2025-07-11">July 11, 2025</time>

      <p>
        Recently, I became interested in self-hosted alternatives to some of the services I use. This came from privacy concerns and the desire to back up all my data and files in one place — while having full access and control over both the server and the data.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, I decided to set up my own self-hosted server.
      </p>

      <p>
        I chose <strong>Runtipi</strong> for this. It’s an open-source platform that makes it easy to manage self-hosted apps and services. You can install apps from its built-in store, configure them, and run everything on your server. The setup is simple — you just run one command:
      </p>

      <pre><code>curl -L https://setup.runtipi.io | bash</code></pre>

      <h3>The Machine</h3>
      <p>
        I used an old laptop: a Dell Latitude E6330 with an Intel i5-3320M CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. That’s plenty for my needs. I connected it to the router via LAN and placed it nearby. For the OS, I chose Ubuntu Server 24.04 — no GUI, minimal resource usage, and everything I need.
      </p>

      <h3>Jellyfin</h3>
      <p>
        To host and stream movies and shows, I use <strong>Jellyfin</strong>. It’s a free and open-source media system with a clean interface and a great Android app. I can easily stream my content to all devices.
      </p>

      <h3>Immich</h3>
      <p>
        For photo backup and organization, I went with <strong>Immich</strong>. I used to have all my photos scattered across devices without order or backup. Now, they’re sorted into albums by year and automatically backed up to my server.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Still Plan to Set Up</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>File server:</strong> Currently I just keep backups in folders on the disk. It works, but I may install Nextcloud later for better file management.</li>
        <li><strong>eBook server:</strong> I read a lot on my Kindle, and storing all books directly on it isn’t ideal. Hosting my own Calibre server sounds like a good idea.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        Each app has its own login system, but I didn’t want to open ports and expose my server to the whole internet. So I made it accessible only within my local network. To access it remotely, I set up an <strong>OpenVPN server</strong> on my router. This way, I can securely connect to my home network and access everything as if I were at home.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Overall, this self-hosted setup has been a fun and educational experience. I’ve learned a lot, and I plan to keep expanding my server with more apps and features. There’s a whole world of open-source self-hosted tools out there — and I’m just getting started.
